## GIt and branching


From master and a clean working team:
  git checkout - b name-branch


pushing a branch (add and commit on a branch)
  git push origin <branch-name>


Go to github to merge branch and master


what happens is the master timeline in github is a head of your local timeline.
so now we need to pull from github


in out local master :
git pull origin master
